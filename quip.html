          <h3>QUIP - Medical Equipment Visibility &amp; Maintenance Platform</h3>
          <p>
            A real-time system designed to help hospitals locate, maintain, and
            extend the life of critical medical equipment -- when access matters
            most. QUIP was built to support healthcare facilities during the
            COVID-19 pandemic by providing immediate visibility into medical
            equipment availability, functionality, and maintenance needs, while
            connecting hospitals to qualified biomedical engineers when expertise
            was scarce.

        <h3>Overview</h3>


        <p>


        QUIP is a healthcare operations platform that enables hospitals to


        track, diagnose, maintain, and procure medical equipment critical to


        patient care. The system provides real-time insight into equipment


        status, automated maintenance workflows, and direct access to


        biomedical engineers -- especially valuable for hospitals without


        in-house BME teams. Since launch, QUIP has trained and onboarded over


        10 biomedical engineers, creating a distributed support network that


        helps hospitals keep life-saving equipment operational and accessible.

        <h3>The Challenge</h3>


        <p>


        During the height of COVID-19, hospitals faced a critical operational


        gap:<br><br>


        - No real-time visibility into functional vs. non-functional equipment<br>


        - Delayed maintenance responses, leading to idle or unusable assets<br>


        - Limited access to biomedical engineers, especially in under-resourced hospitals<br>


        - Manual, fragmented processes for diagnosis, repair, and procurement<br>


        - High data volume environments, causing performance issues in digital systems<br><br>


        In an environment where minutes could determine patient outcomes,


        equipment downtime was not an option.

        <h3>Project Goals</h3>


        <p>


        QUIP was designed to:<br><br>


        - Provide real-time visibility into hospital equipment status<br>


        - Enable fast diagnosis and resolution of equipment issues<br>


        - Connect hospitals to certified biomedical engineers on demand<br>


        - Standardize maintenance workflows across facilities<br>


        - Support equipment procurement and reuse, especially for used assets<br>


        - Remain performant under heavy data loads<br>


        - Serve multiple user roles with clarity and precision<br><br>


        The platform needed to function reliably under pressure -- without


        sacrificing usability.

        <h3>End Users &amp; System Roles</h3>


        <p>


        QUIP supports three primary user groups, each with distinct needs:<br><br>


        LifeBank / QUIP Admin<br>


        - Platform oversight and governance<br>


        - Equipment availability and approval<br>


        - Engineer verification and assignment<br><br>


        Hospital Interface<br>


        - Equipment tracking and diagnosis<br>


        - Maintenance scheduling<br>


        - Spare part requests<br>


        - Equipment purchase requests<br><br>


        Biomedical Engineers (BME)<br>


        - Registration and verification<br>


        - Receiving and responding to service requests<br>


        - Providing diagnostic guidance and repairs<br><br>


        The experience was designed to feel cohesive -- while respecting each


        role's responsibility and urgency.

        <div class="info-text">


        <h3>UX Strategy &amp; Design Rationale</h3>


        <p>


        1. Designing for Real-Time Accountability<br>


        Medical equipment tracking is mission-critical. Every action --


        request, diagnosis, assignment -- needed to be captured instantly and


        visibly. To support this:<br><br>


        - All activities update in real time<br>


        - Status indicators are always visible<br>


        - Notifications confirm every major action<br><br>


        This created a shared source of truth across hospitals, engineers,


        and administrators.<br><br>


        2. Performance-First Interface Design<br>


        Given the volume of equipment data and activity logs, system


        responsiveness was a key risk. To mitigate this, we:<br><br>


        - Limited list and table views to only critical data points<br>


        - Deferred secondary details to drill-down views<br>


        - Reduced on-screen rendering load<br><br>


        This ensured fast performance even under heavy data usage -- without


        compromising operational clarity.<br><br>


        3. Guided Self-Diagnosis to Reduce Downtime<br>


        One of QUIP's most impactful features is Self Diagnosis, designed to


        resolve issues before escalation. Process Flow:<br><br>


        - Hospital staff enters error messages or symptoms<br>


        - System searches maintenance manuals and documentation<br>


        - Automated guidance (authored by BMEs) is displayed<br>


        - User confirms whether the issue is resolved<br><br>


        If unresolved, users can immediately:<br>


        - Request spare parts<br>


        - Book an engineer<br><br>


        This flow reduces unnecessary dispatches and accelerates resolution.<br><br>


        4. Structured Maintenance Workflows<br>


        Maintenance scheduling was designed to reflect real hospital


        operations. Users can:<br><br>


        - Auto-fill equipment details using QUIP ID<br>


        - Choose between routine or emergency maintenance<br>


        - Select frequency (weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc.)<br>


        - Schedule date and time<br><br>


        Each action is confirmed via notification, ensuring transparency and


        traceability.<br><br>


        5. Engineer Network &amp; Dispatch System<br>


        To address the shortage of in-house BMEs, QUIP enables:<br><br>


        - Engineer sign-up and verification<br>


        - Admin approval of BME registrations<br>


        - Assignment of engineers to hospital requests<br>


        - Centralized oversight of all dispatch activity<br><br>


        This system transformed isolated hospitals into connected participants


        in a shared healthcare support network.<br><br>


        6. Controlled Equipment Procurement &amp; Reuse<br>


        Equipment purchasing was intentionally designed as a request-based


        workflow, not an instant transaction. Key design decisions:<br><br>


        - Removal of direct payment from purchase flow<br>


        - Admin approval or decline based on availability<br>


        - Notification-driven progression to payment<br>


        - All hospital-listed equipment marked as USED by default<br>


        - Admins verify quality before approval, ensuring safety and


        accountability.

        <h3>Admin Interface Capabilities</h3>


        <p>


        The Admin dashboard serves as the operational backbone of QUIP,


        enabling:<br><br>


        - Viewing all registered hospitals<br>


        - Monitoring all equipment across facilities<br>


        - Tagging and categorizing equipment<br>


        - Reviewing and approving BME registrations<br>


        - Managing engineer requests and assignments<br><br>


        The interface prioritizes clarity, speed, and oversight -- supporting


        critical decision-making.
