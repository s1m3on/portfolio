          <h3>Meritrade - NGX Trading Platform</h3>
          <p>
            Meritrade is a digital trading platform designed around the Nigerian
            Stock Exchange (NGX), enabling users to buy and sell stocks,
            commodities, and bonds through a streamlined mobile experience.
            The platform integrates a secure digital wallet for funding and
            settlement, a comprehensive portfolio dashboard for monitoring
            investments, and market analysis tools that surface actionable
            insights. Built on Meristem's long-standing credibility in financial
            services, Meritrade modernizes stock trading while preserving the
            trust expected from a well-established institution.

        <h3>The Challenge</h3>


        <p>


        While Meristem had strong brand recognition and investor trust, its


        digital trading experience faced several usability and engagement


        challenges:<br><br>


        - High friction onboarding, slowing time to first trade<br>


        - Complex trading interfaces that overwhelmed non-professional investors<br>


        - Limited personalization, requiring users to manually track market movements<br>


        - Underutilized portfolio insights, reducing long-term engagement<br>


        - Accessibility gaps for an older demographic<br><br>


        The platform needed to appeal to a broad audience -- from experienced


        traders to first-time investors -- without compromising clarity,


        confidence, or performance.

        <h3>Project Goals</h3>


        <p>


        The objective was to design a trading platform that:<br><br>


        - Simplified access to NGX trading for all experience levels<br>


        - Reduced onboarding time and accelerated first engagement<br>


        - Enabled informed decision-making through market insights and analysis<br>


        - Built trust through clarity, tone, and visual consistency<br>


        - Increased trading frequency via timely, personalized engagement<br>


        - Delivered an accessible experience for users aged 35-65<br><br>


        The product needed to feel professional, dependable, and intuitive --


        not intimidating.

        <h3>UX Strategy &amp; Design Rationale</h3>


        <p>


        1. Designing for Trust and Accessibility<br>


        With a core demographic of users aged 35-65, accessibility was


        foundational to every design decision. We focused on:<br><br>


        - Clean layouts with clear separation of content<br>


        - Refined, legible typography<br>


        - High-contrast color usage<br>


        - Predictable navigation patterns<br><br>


        These choices reduced cognitive load while reinforcing Meristem's


        credibility.<br><br>


        2. Streamlined Onboarding for Faster Activation<br>


        User research revealed that lengthy onboarding flows were a primary


        drop-off point. To address this, we:<br><br>


        - Simplified identity verification steps<br>


        - Introduced progressive disclosure<br>


        - Provided contextual guidance during setup<br>


        - Reduced the path to first trade<br><br>


        The result was a significantly faster time to first meaningful action.<br><br>


        3. Portfolio Dashboard as a Central Command Center<br>


        The portfolio view was redesigned to surface what matters most:<br><br>


        - Current holdings<br>


        - Asset allocation<br>


        - Real-time performance<br>


        - Gains and losses over time<br><br>


        By prioritizing clarity over complexity, users could quickly understand


        their financial position without navigating multiple screens.<br><br>


        4. Market Trend Analysis for Informed Trading<br>


        To support confident decision-making, Meritrade integrates market trend


        tools that:<br><br>


        - Highlight price movements<br>


        - Surface volume changes<br>


        - Provide contextual market signals<br><br>


        These insights are presented in a simplified, visual format -- designed


        to inform, not overwhelm.<br><br>


        5. Personalized Trade Recommendations &amp; Alerts<br>


        User research identified a strong demand for proactive engagement. We


        introduced:<br><br>


        - Personalized trade suggestions based on user behavior<br>


        - User-defined push notifications for price changes, market movements,


        and reminders<br>


        - Alerts aligned with individual portfolio interests<br><br>


        This feature bridged the gap between passive monitoring and active


        trading.<br><br>


        6. Integrated Digital Wallet for Seamless Transactions<br>


        Meritrade's built-in wallet enables users to:<br><br>


        - Fund accounts securely<br>


        - Execute trades without friction<br>


        - Track transaction history transparently<br><br>


        By eliminating external dependencies, the platform creates a cohesive


        trading flow from funding to execution.
