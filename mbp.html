          <h3>The Challenge</h3>

          <p>
            Proposals are deeply emotional -- yet planning one can be
            overwhelming. Common challenges include:<br><br>
            - Uncertainty about how to plan the perfect proposal
            - Lack of inspiration or confidence in execution
            - Difficulty finding trusted planners, especially remotely
            - Scattered experiences across inspiration, planning, and purchasing
            - Limited platforms for couples to share and celebrate their stories<br><br>
            The platform needed to balance romance with practicality --
            inspiration with execution.

          <h3>UX Strategy &amp; Design Rationale</h3>

          <p>
            1. Emotion-First Storytelling<br>
            Featured proposals highlight the couple, the setting, and the
            emotional journey leading up to the moment. Large visuals, soft
            typography, and generous spacing allow each story to breathe.
            Users connect emotionally before taking action.<br><br>

            2. Inspiration to Action Flow<br>
            The experience guides users from Inspiration to Confidence to
            Planning to Purchase. Planning and commerce are integrated alongside
            stories to reduce friction between dreaming and doing.<br><br>

            3. Guided Proposal Planning<br>
            The Plan Your Proposal flow captures location, budget, references,
            and special notes. This structure enables planners to deliver
            tailored proposals across different locations.<br><br>

            4. Trust Through Language &amp; Design<br>
            Reassuring copy, supportive messaging, and professional layouts build
            confidence for first-time users.<br><br>

            5. Community-Driven Story Sharing<br>
            Users can submit their own proposal stories, expanding content
            organically and reinforcing authenticity.<br><br>

            6. Integrated Online Store<br>
            The store extends the proposal experience with journals, couple
            mugs, wedding rings and keepsakes, and gift items for milestones.
            It is woven naturally into the experience without interrupting the
            emotional flow.<br><br>

            7. Visual Consistency &amp; Brand Identity<br>
            Soft color palettes, elegant typography, clean layouts, and
            high-quality imagery ensure a consistent emotional tone across
            storytelling, planning, and commerce.
