        <h3>Overview</h3>


        <p>


        The Blusalt Client Portal is an enterprise financial management


        platform that enables users to oversee multi-layered customer


        networks -- including merchants, agents, partners, and service


        providers. Through a single interface, users can:<br><br>


        - Track inflows and outflows of wallet transactions<br>


        - Configure service fees and commissions<br>


        - Monitor sales performance across services<br>


        - Manage customer access and roles<br>


        - Audit platform activity in real time<br><br>


        The portal acts as the operational nerve center for Blusalt's fintech


        ecosystem.

        <h3>The Challenge</h3>


        <p>


        As Blusalt's platform scaled, so did the complexity of managing


        diverse customer entities and high transaction volumes. Key


        challenges included:<br><br>


        - Fragmented visibility across agents, merchants, and partners<br>


        - Manual oversight of commissions and service usage<br>


        - Delayed detection of suspicious or irregular activity<br>


        - Role complexity, making access management difficult<br>


        - Data overload, limiting fast decision-making<br><br>


        The platform required a design system that could simplify complexity


        without losing depth.

        <h3>Project Goals</h3>


        <p>


        The primary goals were to:<br><br>


        - Deliver real-time financial visibility across the entire customer network<br>


        - Enable granular control over fees, commissions, and services<br>


        - Support role-based access and permissions<br>


        - Surface actionable insights through clear dashboards<br>


        - Strengthen platform security and trust<br>


        - Support rapid investigation and response to suspicious activity<br><br>


        The experience needed to feel authoritative, reliable, and effortless


        -- even under heavy data usage.

        <h3>UX Strategy &amp; Design Rationale</h3>


        <p>


        1. Dashboard-First Decision Making<br>


        Given the volume of transactions processed daily, the dashboard was


        designed to prioritize at-a-glance clarity. Key considerations:<br><br>


        - High-level transaction summaries<br>


        - Clear visual indicators for inflow vs outflow<br>


        - Sales and service performance metrics<br>


        - Progressive disclosure for deeper analysis<br><br>


        This approach allows users to understand platform health within


        seconds.<br><br>


        2. Structured Network Management<br>


        Each customer type -- agents, merchants, partners -- was designed as


        a distinct but consistent module, enabling familiarity without


        confusion. Agents include profile management, wallet transactions,


        commissions, and activation controls. Merchants include profile


        overview, wallet history, and team management with role definitions


        (Super Admin, Operations, Admin, Customer Service). This structure


        supports scalability while maintaining clarity.<br><br>


        3. Partner &amp; Service Visibility<br>


        Partners often operate across multiple services and merchants. The


        Partner module enables users to view partner profiles and wallet


        activity, track commissions, see associated merchants, and monitor


        services such as bill payments, SMS, airtime &amp; data bundles, cable


        TV, and electricity. This holistic view reduces blind spots and


        improves accountability.<br><br>


        4. Financial Configuration &amp; Control<br>


        To support flexible business models, users can set or adjust service


        fees, define commission structures, and monitor performance impact in


        real time. This feedback loop empowers informed strategic decisions.<br><br>


        5. Audit, Reporting &amp; Compliance<br>


        Security and traceability were foundational. Users can access audit


        trails, login histories, and transaction records to support


        compliance requirements, fraud detection, and operational reviews.


        Every action is logged -- reinforcing trust and accountability.<br><br>


        6. Rapid Response to Risk<br>


        Users can instantly deactivate agents or merchants, restrict access


        to services, and investigate anomalies through detailed logs. The


        interface ensures that critical actions are clear, deliberate, and


        reversible where necessary.
